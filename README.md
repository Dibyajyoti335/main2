I have made a linear regression model, which is 1st trained by the dataset I made myself. I have divided the dataset into two parts, training data and testing data in the ratio of 5:3. The link to the dataset is pasted below: C:\Users\DIBYAJYOTI HALOI\OneDrive\Desktop\c++++++\datasheet.csv
 

The main objective of my model is to predict the price of the house(label) from the area of that particular house as input(feature). 1st I have trained the model from the trained data, where the model is fed the input and output of the trained data. After training, I gave the model the test data as input(Areas) and saw the predicted value of the house prices. Then I calculated the mean squared error(mean of the square of actual price from test data(Areas) minus predicted price from test data(Areas)), which gave me the accuracy of the model.

Algorithm: From the trained data model, find a line(y=m*x+b) where x=Area and y=Price in the case of my model and the model find the line in such a way that the mean squared error is minimum.
Mean squared error:
1) Get the predicted price from the test data(Areas).
2) Take the difference between the actual price of test data and the Predicted price of test data.
3) Square all the differences and take their mean
By keeping the mean squared error minimum model, find the line which best suits the predicted values.
